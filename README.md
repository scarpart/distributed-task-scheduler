#### **_NOTE_ 1**: this is a work in progress. main is most likely not updated. check the `not-yet-working` or `dev` branches to see what I'm currently up to. 
#### **_NOTE_ 2.**: for now, I've only implemented the Load Balancer - not quite ready to work, but getting very close to it. After that, I'll implement the Task Queue, probably. 

# distributed-task-scheduler
A distributed task scheduler application written in Go using its concurrency features. When complete, it will have a load manager, task queue, databases and more. This system follows the general structure and architecture as the one shown in the diagram below (credit: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/system-design-designing-a-distributed-job-scheduler-6d3b6d714fdb)
